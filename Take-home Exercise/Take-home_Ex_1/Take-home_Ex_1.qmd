# **Ⅰ**. Overview

## Background

Understanding the drivers of student success is a long-standing challenge in education. Research indicates that learning outcomes are shaped by a complex interplay of internal factors, such as student motivation and interest, and external factors, including family socioeconomic status, teacher support, and institutional facilities.

In the Vietnamese context, studies emphasize that student self-efficacy and lecturer capacity are pivotal to academic performance. Additionally, the quality of educational services and campus environment significantly impacts student satisfaction and outcomes.

This study leverages a comprehensive dataset from the University of Education, Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU-UET). By applying R-driven visualizations, we aim to uncover how these diverse elements—ranging from pedagogical approaches to learning conditions, influence the academic journeys of 2,170 students and alumni in the digital age.

## The Data

This analysis utilizes a 2023 survey dataset from the **University of Education, Vietnam National University, Hanoi**, to explore factors influencing student learning outcomes.

### Data Source

-   [Dataset about VNU students (Original data)](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/23ppcdbmhc/1)

## Task

Using the **2023 Student Questionnaire Dataset** from the University of Education, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, this post aims to apply appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods and **ggplot2** functions to uncover and communicate key observations regarding the factors influencing student learning outcomes.

-   **Tools:** It highlights the required use of **R** and **ggplot2** mentioned in your instructions.

-   **Goal:** It maintains the core requirement of finding **5 to 10 observations**.

# **Ⅱ.** Loading Package

| Library | Description |
|----|----|
| [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) | A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling. |
| [**haven**](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) | To enable R to read and write various data formats such as SAS and SPSS. |
| [**knitr**](https://yihui.org/knitr/) | For dynamic report generation. |
| [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) | For preparing composite figure created using ggplot2. |
| [**ggthemes**](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/) | Extra themes, geoms, and scales for ggplot2. |
| [**scales**](https://scales.r-lib.org/) | For data labels and annotations for ggplot2. |
| [**ggridges**](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/) | For ridgeline plots that create the impression of a mountain range. |
| [**ggpubr**](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/) | For publication-ready plots. |

The following code chunk uses `p_load()` of **pacman** package to check if the packages are installed in the computer. If they are, the libraries will be called into R.

```{r}
#| label: load-libraries
#| message: false
#| warning: false

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, knitr, patchwork, 
               ggthemes, scales, ggridges, ggpubr,
               gganimate, ggdist, ggtext, ggextra, 
               cowplot, ggnewscale)
```

# Ⅲ. Data Wrangling

## Import Data

The dataset (`data/Database paper.xlsx`) used in this exercise is the Student Learning Outcomes survey dataretrieved from the University of Education, Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU-UET). It contains responses from 2,170 students and alumni collected in 2023.

We import this dataset as `stu_data`.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl) 
library(ggstatsplot)
stu_data <- read_excel("data/Database paper.xlsx")
```

## Variable Selection

To maintain consistency with the survey structure provided in the dataset, I have retained variables that are grouped into three primary categories. These groupings help in systematically analyzing how different dimensions of a student’s life contribute to their overall academic success:

-   **Group A – Student Demographics**: This category establishes the **foundational profile** of the participants. It encompasses innate characteristics such as gender and year of study, alongside socio-economic indicators like parental background and daily time management habits.

-   **Group B – Learning Perceptions**: This group captures the **subjective academic experience**. By analyzing factors like adaptability to the university environment and perceptions of teaching quality, we can measure the "process" of learning.

-   **Group C – Grade Point Average (GPA)**: Acting as the **primary performance metric**, GPA is categorized into five ordinal levels (from "Poor" to "Excellent") to represent defined academic outcomes.

The following detailed list provides a roadmap for our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we will investigate the correlations between these foundational factors, student perceptions, and final academic achievements.

## Handling Missing Value

We ran the code to check for missing values and found no missing values in the dataset.

```{r}
for(column_name in names(stu_data)) {
  na_count <- sum(is.na(stu_data[[column_name]]))
  
  if (na_count > 0) {
    message("Column '", column_name, "' has ", na_count, " NA values.")
  } else {print(paste(column_name, ": No missing values"))

## Check for Duplicates

Using the `duplicated` function.we see that there are 22 duplicate entries in the data.

```{r}
stu_data[duplicated(stu_data),]
```

```{r}
stu_data_labeled <- stu_data_labeled %>%
  distinct()

nrow(stu_data_labeled)
```

:::::: observation-box
::: observation-header
**Observations:**
:::

::: observation-image
![](images/glasses.png){width="100"}
:::

::: observation-content
Upon checking the dataset, we identified **226 rows** that are exact duplicates across all 22 variables. Since the dataset lacks a **Primary Key** (e.g., Student ID), these duplicates could represent either:

1.  **Two different students** providing identical survey responses.
2.  **Duplicate submissions** from the same student.

To ensure data integrity, we will treat these as duplicate entries and retain only unique records.

-   **Scale as Continuous Numeric:** The variable GPA and Learning Perceptions (B.1–B.9) are treated as continuous numeric scales (1–5). This approach is chosen to allow for the calculation of mean scores and the performance of correlation analyses to identify trends.
-   **Categorical Conversion:** Other demographic variables, such as `Gender`, `Year`, and `Parents' Background`, are currently stored as numeric codes. These will be re-labeled as **categorical strings** to ensure the EDA charts are intuitive and human-readable.

# IV Univariate Analysis

The following section presents the Univariable Analysis for this project.

## **Target Variables: GPA**

To begin our univariate analysis, we must first examine the distribution of the target variable. In this study, the focus is on **GPA scores**. By combining a **histogram** with a **boxplot**, we can effectively visualize the score distribution, identify central tendencies (Mean and Median), and detect any potential outliers among the student population.

```{r}
#| label: gpa-distribution-final
#| echo: true

mean_gpa <- round(mean(stu_data_labeled$GPA_Score, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
median_gpa <- median(stu_data_labeled$GPA_Score, na.rm = TRUE)
min_gpa <- min(stu_data_labeled$GPA_Score, na.rm = TRUE)
max_gpa <- max(stu_data_labeled$GPA_Score, na.rm = TRUE)

# Boxplot
box_gpa <- ggplot(stu_data_labeled, aes(y = GPA_Score, x = "")) +

-   **GPA Distribution:** The majority of students' scores are concentrated between 3 and 4.
-   An important observation is that the mean (3.29) is slightly higher than the median (3.0), which indicates that the distribution is slightly right-skewed.

## Demographics Distribution

For student demographics, we opted for **bar charts** as they are the standard for visualizing **nominal and ordinal categorical data**. This format allows for the seamless ordering of ordinal variables like education levels while providing **direct labels** to minimize chart junk and maximize data accessibility. By maintaining a consistent design across nine variables, we ensure that the socio-economic and institutional profile of our sample remains clear and comparable.

-   **Sample Composition Bias:** The dataset is highly specific, predominantly consisting of **female students (88.8%)** and those who have already **graduated (72%)**. This suggests that the study's conclusions will be most representative of the experiences of female graduates rather than a diverse undergraduate population.
-   **Relatively Stable Socio-economic Status:** The vast majority of respondents are not from impoverished backgrounds (95.7%) and do not belong to minority groups (93.5%). Additionally, a significant portion of parents have attained High School or University/Graduate education, indicating a relatively stable home environment for most students.
-   There is a clear concentration in parental occupations towards Freelance and Self-employment (over 50% combined for both fathers and mothers). This high rate of non-institutional employment might influence the students' own study habits or time allocation patterns.

-   **Surprising Digital Habits:** This finding really surprised me. Contrary to the assumption that students are "glued" to their screens, over 70% of this group spend less than 3 hours daily on social media.
-   **Extreme Academic Focus:** The data shows an overwhelming 81.6% of students studying for over 8 hours a day. This suggests a very disciplined and academic-focused cohort.
-   **A Note on Metrics:** I suspect some students included official school hours in their "study time." To get a clearer picture of their self-discipline, focusing specifically on independent study time after school would make more sense.

## Learning Perception

Since these variables are primarily **Likert scale survey scores**, I utilized a **Diverging Bar Chart** to better visualize student attitudes toward each metric. By centering neutral responses and using a **Red-to-Blue color gradient**, this approach provides an intuitive comparison of sentiment intensity while reducing "chart junk" for a clearer academic profile.

## **Comparing GPA distribution**

Next, I focus on how **Time Allocation** across different activities significantly influences learning outcomes. To clearly present these relationships, I utilize **Density Ridges** because they offer a more nuanced view than simple averages; they emphasize the **"peaks"** in the distribution and capture the full **shape and variation** of academic performance, making it easy to identify bimodal patterns or subtle shifts across different groups.

-   Since GPA data was collected via survey options (e.g., discrete levels), its non-continuous nature causes the ridgeline plots to exhibit multiple sharp peaks rather than a smooth, normal distribution curve.

-   **The "Bimodal" Social Effect:** Both social media and peer interaction show bimodal peaks at GPA 3.0 and 4.0. This implies that academic outcomes are driven more by individual time management skills than by the sheer number of social hours.

-   **Academic Resilience:** Even in groups with high social media usage (over 4 hours), the core GPA density remains stable above 3.0. This reflects strong academic resilience within the sample, where external distractions do not significantly erode core performance.

## Comparing GPA distribution of parents' status

In this section, I explore how parental background,specifically **Education Level** and **Occupation** influences student **GPA scores**.

To analyze these socioeconomic factors, I utilize **Stacked Density Ridges** with a **mean point layer**. This visualization is particularly effective because it allows for a precise comparison of the central tendencies (means) between fathers and mothers while simultaneously showing the full distribution of scores. It helps uncover whether certain parental backgrounds are associated with more consistent academic performance or higher concentrations of excellence.

-   **Educational Catalyst & Baseline:** Advanced parental education (University/graduate) is the strongest predictor for the **GPA 4.0** "excellence" peak, while GPA 3.0 remains a robust and universal baseline across all socioeconomic backgrounds.

-   **Parental Symmetry:** In most education and occupation categories, the influence of Fathers and Mothers is **nearly identical**, showing overlapping distributions and highly consistent mean GPA scores.

-   The "**Not public**" (private sector) category is a unique exception where fathers are associated with a significantly more pronounced and sharper peak at GPA 4.0 compared to mothers.

-   **Methodological Limitation (Discrete Data)**: A primary drawback of using Raincloud Plots for this dataset is the **discrete nature of GPA scores**. Because the data is concentrated at specific intervals (e.g., 2.0, 3.0, 4.0), the density "clouds" appear as sharp spikes rather than smooth curves. This can be visually misleading as the kernel density estimation attempts to interpolate values between these fixed thresholds where no data actually exists.

-   **Minority Academic Stability**: The **Minority (Yes)** group shows higher stability, with significantly fewer data points in the low GPA range (1.0 - 2.0) compared to the "No" group.

-   **Uniform Baseline**: Median GPA for both groups remains consistently near the overall average, indicating no severe academic polarization within this sample.

# **VI** Inferential Analysis

In the perception analysis, **`Adapt_Learning_Uni`** stood out as a key area of concern. As a pre-data analyst, I will use **One-way ANOVA** to investigate its correlation with GPA. This method is ideal for my dataset because it allows for the **simultaneous comparison** of GPA means across all five adaptation levels, maintaining a lower error rate than multiple t-tests. Furthermore, ANOVA scientifically breaks down GPA variance into "Group Effects" and "Random Errors" to confirm statistical significance.

## **ANOVA**

The core principle of this analysis is the decomposition of variance, expressed by the following formula:

$$SS_{Total} = SS_{Between} + SS_{Within}$$

By comparing these two components, we can determine if the "Adaptation Level" effect is statistically significant.

```{r}
#| label: anova-plot-with-formula

ggbetweenstats(
  data = stu_data_labeled,
  x = Adapt_Learning_Uni,
  y = GPA_Score,
  type = "parametric", 
  title = "Distribution of GPA by University Adaptation",
  package = "ggthemes",
  palette = "Tableau_10"
)
```

```{r}
stu_data_labeled$Adapt_Learning_Uni <- as.factor(stu_data_labeled$Adapt_Learning_Uni)

# ANOVA
anova_adapt <- aov(GPA_Score ~ Adapt_Learning_Uni, data = stu_data_labeled)

summary(anova_adapt)

# if P-value < 0.05  Tukey 
TukeyHSD(anova_adapt)
```

The **One-way ANOVA** confirms a highly significant relationship between university adaptation and academic achievement (F(4,1939)=8.918, **p\<.001**).

-   **Adaptation Performance Gap**: Students with "Very" or "Quite" high adaptation scores significantly outperform those with "Little" adaptation, with a substantial GPA gap of **0.36 to 0.39 points**.

-   **Adjustment Plateau**: No statistical difference **(**p**=0.986)** exists between "Very" and "Quite" adapted groups, suggesting that once a baseline level of adjustment is reached, GPA tends to stabilize.

-   **Empirical Validation**: These findings validate the earlier **Diverging Analysis**, proving that the high frequency of negative responses in **`Adapt_Learning_Uni`** directly translates to lower academic outcomes.

# **VII. Summary**

Our analysis of VNU-UET students' GPA performance, and its relationship with demographic characteristics, time allocation, family background, and university adaptation, has yielded several key insights. Overall, the analysis reveals that academic success is shaped by an interplay of various factors, with **university adaptation** emerging as the most decisive predictor of student performance.

Key Finding :

-   GPA scores are concentrated between 3.0 and 4.0 with a slightly right-skewed distribution.

-   Over 80% of students maintain extreme academic focus (8+ hours study), while moderate social media use does not hinder performance.

-   University adaptation is a primary driver of success, with high adaptation increasing GPA by nearly 0.4 points.

-   Academic gains reach a plateau once a baseline level of adaptation is achieved.

-   Advanced parental education serves as a catalyst for excellence, while minority groups demonstrate consistent academic stability.

Recommendations for Future Research

-   **Deepening Causal Inference**: While this analysis established correlations through **ANOVA**, future studies should incorporate multi-variable regression modeling to control for confounding factors and establish more definitive causal pathways.

-   **Exploring Psychological Variables**: Beyond learning perceptions, future research should investigate internal mechanisms such as **student motivation, resilience, and mental health indicators** to gain a more holistic understanding of academic drivers.

-   **Longitudinal Tracking of Teaching Quality**: Given the high satisfaction with "Lecturer Quality" and "Training Curriculum," longitudinal studies could track how specific pedagogical improvements influence student achievement over time.

-   **Data Precision and Scaling**: To address the spikes observed in Raincloud Plots due to the discrete nature of the data, future surveys should utilize continuous scales to capture a smoother and more precise statistical distribution.

By addressing these areas, future research can provide a more comprehensive framework for developing targeted support policies, particularly for student groups struggling with initial university adaptation.
