Hi there! I’m **Cooper**, a graduate student currently pursuing a **Master of IT in Business (MITB)** at **Singapore Management University (SMU)**.

This website serves as a digital gallery of my learning journey in **Data Visualization**. Throughout my coursework, I have focused on transforming complex datasets into clear, impactful, and interactive visual stories. My goal is to bridge the gap between technical analysis and business insights through effective design.

I’m glad to have you here! Feel free to explore my projects and see how I apply visualization techniques to solve real-world problems.
